          Hi,
          My name is Ivan Salamanca
          I'm 22 years old, and I live in Ciudad Juarez (in Mexico).
          I'm currently studying a career in Chemistry (in person) at UACJ, but I'm enrolled in BYU Idaho Online as
          well.
          I like literature, but I don't read as often today as I used to years ago. Nevertheless, I can recall a few
          good lines from J.R.R. Tolkien, J. Verne, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Mary Shelley, Victor Hugo, Elsa Punset,
          Charlotte Brontë, Robert Greene, and other authors.
          I've been a member of the Church for fourteen years now .
          My greatest joy in life is partaking of the sacrament each week, and beign in sunday school as a teacher. I
          love every opportunity that I have to teach the gospel to a big group.
          I served a speaking spanish mission at Mexico City, Southeast Mission. I just came back in the spring of 2022.
          I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan.
          I currently work as a driver for Didi.
          I love that BYU Idaho allows me to study online through this program.
          I'm taking this course because I think that, in coming days, it will not be possible to survive without
          programming skills.

          This one is a Scripture that I like: And there will I meet thee, and I will go before thee into a land which
          is choice above all the lands of the
          earth.
          -Ether 1:42

    <h3>Before We Start</h3>
    <p>We will present several examples of organic chemistry mechanisms to explain molecular phenomena.</p>

    <h3>Nucleophilic Interaction</h3>
    <p>In this reaction, the alkene group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the adjacent molecule, causing that the chlorine turns into a leaving group.</p>

    <h3>Electrofilic Behavior</h3>
    <p>In this reaction, carbon works as a electrophile. Both, the -nitro group and the chlorine, drain electrons from this atom. That's why the double bond is displaced towards the carbon.</p>

    <h3>Reaction Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>
      This page is totally consacrated to alkyl halides, alcohols, aromatic rings, and carboxylic acids reactions. We will set forth the expected mechanism for a certain reaction.

    <h3>We are here to help</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      If your teacher is very demanding with his subject, we can teach you about organometallic reagents, heterocyclic rings, and inorganic oxidizers. We can talk about the effects of each reactive and their mechanism.
